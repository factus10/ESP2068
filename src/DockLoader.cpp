ESP2068 — TS2068 port of ESPectrum

DockLoader.cpp — see include/DockLoader.h.

Container format (bank ID + 8 chunk-type bytes per bank, 8192-byte images
for present chunks, repeat to EOF) matches test/dock/dck_format.py
exactly — that Python module was written first and cross-checked against
two independent copies of the source reference; this is a direct C++
port of the same logic, not a re-derivation.

Autostart design, and a real bug this caught:

TS2068-ESPECTRUM-PORT-PLAN.md's "Cartridge loading" section says LROS/
AROS autostart cartridges "page themselves in and vector execution on
reset" and points at check_trdos (Z80_JLS.cpp) as a working template —
that mechanism watches the Z80's PC on every jump/call/return, because
TR-DOS can be entered at any point during a running program, not just at
boot. This does NOT use that pattern: LROS cartridges are defined to
always autorun "after initialization is finished" (boot only, unlike
TR-DOS), so a one-shot apply at reset is enough — no continuous PC watch
needed.

An earlier version of this file also skipped parsing the cartridge's own
in-ROM header at all, reasoning that LROS "takes total control from
address 0" so the Z80 already lands in the right place after
Z80::reset(). **That reasoning was wrong, caught by testing against a
real cartridge** (Zebra OS-64.BIN, see PLAN.md's slice 3 "real ROM/DOCK
end-to-end test" writeup): a real LROS header occupies bytes 0-4 of
chunk 0 as pure metadata (unused byte, cartridge-type byte, a 2-byte
start-address field, a chunk-spec byte) — NOT executable code — and the
start-address field points at wherever the cartridge's actual entry
point is, which is often close to but not necessarily exactly address 0
(Zebra's is $0005: a JP instruction to $0D9E). Executing from PC=0
unconditionally, as the earlier version did, would run the header bytes
themselves as garbage instructions.

The fix: read the 2-byte start-address field (chunk 0, offset 2-3,
little-endian) when chunk 0 is present and expose it via
autostartEntryPoint(). CPU::reset()'s autostart hookup now calls
Z80::setRegPC() with it after paging the cartridge in, instead of
relying on Z80::reset()'s PC=0. The chunk-enable mask itself
(autostartMmuSelect()) is still derived from the .DCK container's own
chunk-presence bits rather than the header's chunk-spec byte — those two
should always agree for a correctly-packaged cartridge (verified true
for the real Zebra/eToolkit cartridges used in testing), and the
container's bits are what's actually fully spec'd and already parsed
here regardless.

This does not attempt AROS autostart (depends on a working System ROM,
which doesn't exist yet — see slice 1's still-open ROM-image TODO) or a
mid-session, check_trdos-style PC watch (nothing to watch for yet without
a real EXROM image with a "launch cartridge" entry point). Revisit both
once those exist.

Context for whenever AROS autostart IS attempted (as told directly by
the project owner, 2026-07-10 — not yet independently located in the
disassembly despite a search of the HOME ROM text for SYSCON/DOCK/
ARSFLG scan logic, so treat as reliable but not yet self-verified):
real HOME ROM init scans the DOCK connector and detects LROS vs AROS.
For AROS specifically, it jumps directly to the address the cartridge
specifies — but an AROS cartridge doesn't contain a real reset handler
at address 0 (no DI, etc.), so it can't safely take a RST 0. When RST 0
fires while the AROS cartridge is paged in, the hardware pages HOME ROM
back in to handle it properly, and the whole detect-and-jump sequence
runs again. This is what lets an AROS-style ROM replacement bootstrap
with minimal hardware engineering: it doesn't need its own complete RST
vector table, HOME ROM keeps catching RST 0 for it. If this port ever
emulates a real HOME-ROM-driven boot (rather than DockLoader computing
the jump itself, as it does now), this loop is what needs replicating —
and check_trdos-style PC watching (deliberately not built above,
because LROS doesn't need it) becomes directly relevant for it, since
RST 0 can fire at any point, not just at boot.
