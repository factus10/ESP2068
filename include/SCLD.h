ESP2068 — TS2068 port of ESPectrum

SCLD.h — memory-management-unit and display-control register contract
for the Timex Sinclair 2068's SCLD chip. New for this port; there is no
upstream ESPectrum equivalent. See TS2068-ESPECTRUM-PORT-PLAN.md for the
full SCLD register spec this header implements, and PLAN.md (Phase 1)
for why this file exists on its own, ahead of any real implementation.

Based on ESPectrum, a Sinclair ZX Spectrum emulator for Espressif ESP32 SoC

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This is the interface every port slice codes against (see
// TS2068-ESPECTRUM-PORT-PLAN.md, "Interface to agree before anyone writes
// code"). Its shape is frozen as of PLAN.md Phase 1 — changing it once
// slices 2/3 are underway needs sign-off from whoever owns slice 1 (MMU +
// memory core), since the 8-slot memory model is the one place a mismatch
// is subtle rather than a compile error.
//
// Slice 1 (PLAN.md Phase 2) fills in real bodies: HOME ROM/RAM backing
// store is allocated by allocateMemory() and always present; DOCK/EXROM
// chunks resolve to a shared, read-only, zeroed "empty socket" page until
// something calls loadDockChunk()/loadExromImage() (slice 3's job) — real
// hardware doesn't crash when you read an empty cartridge socket, and
// neither does memChunk[], since it is never null.
//
// SCLD.cpp is written to also compile host-side (outside the ESP-IDF/
// PlatformIO build) when ESP2068_HOST_TEST is defined, so the exact same
// resolve logic backs both the firmware and test/host/scld_test.cpp — see
// PLAN.md Phase 2, slice 1 exit criteria ("a simple host-side harness").

    // matched real `OUT (n),A`/`IN A,(n)` traffic when the accumulator
    // happened to be 0 — real Z80 hardware puts the accumulator's value
    // on the address bus's upper byte for those instructions, so

    // boundary, which is what makes this fit the memChunk[] model cleanly.

    // Which DFILE(s) a given videoMode actually needs is NOT a single
    // toggle and is deliberately left to slice 2, not decided here: mode
    // 000 reads DFILE1 only, 001 reads DFILE2 only, 010 reads DFILE1 for
    // pixels *and* DFILE2 for attributes simultaneously, and 110 interleaves
    // both column-by-column. A single "use secondary?" bool can't represent
    // 010/110, so this header stops at exposing the two bases.
