ESP2068 — TS2068 port of ESPectrum

SCLDVideo.h — pixel-expansion core for the TS2068's SCLD display modes.
New for this port; there is no upstream ESPectrum equivalent.

This is deliberately narrow: it answers "given these source bytes/rows/
columns, which pixels are ink vs paper, and what memory offset holds
them" and nothing else — not color/RGB conversion, not framebuffer
writes, not VGA/DMA timing. That keeps it pure and host-testable (see
test/host/scldvideo_test.cpp), which matters because this *spatial*
math (bit order, interleave order, row addressing) is exactly the kind
of off-by-one that's easy to get subtly wrong and hard to notice by eye
on real hardware — a wrong ink/paper swap still "looks like a picture,"
just a mirrored or miscolored one. It also turned out to matter in
practice: the attribute-row formula that used to live inline in
Video.cpp (not here, not tested) had exactly this kind of bug — see
below.

Corrected 2026-07-10 against the FUSE emulator's source (a mature,
real, TS2068-emulating GPL codebase — /Users/david/Downloads/fuse-1.9.0
locally; peripherals/scld.c, display.c, display.h, ui/fb/fbdisplay.c),
after an earlier version of this file got two things wrong that a TS2068
reference library's summarized docs hadn't caught:

  - Standard mode's attribute-row addressing used to live inline in
    Video.cpp as `0x1800 + row * 32` (row = pixel row, 0..191) — wrong,
    since attributes are per 8x8 character cell and only change every 8
    pixel rows. FUSE's display_attr_start[y] = 6144 + 32*(y/8) is the
    correct shape; standardAttributeOffset() below matches it exactly.
    This was live in the shipped renderer with no test ever exercising
    it — the bitmap-row formula (standardBitmapOffset(), below) *was*
    hand-verified against known Spectrum addressing facts before
    shipping and turned out to be correct (independently re-confirmed
    against FUSE's display_line_start[] init loop, exact algebraic
    match) — the asymmetry is the point: hand-verification without an
    automated test is exactly how the attribute-row bug got through.

  - Hi-res mode's dual-file interleave used to be bit-by-bit alternating
    (DFILE1 bit i at output 2i, DFILE2 bit i at output 2i+1) — wrong.
    FUSE's uidisplay_plot16 (ui/fb/fbdisplay.c) shows a 16-bit value
    `(dfile1_byte << 8) | dfile2_byte` expanded MSB-first straight
    across 16 pixels — i.e. a BLOCK arrangement (all 8 bits of the
    DFILE1 byte, then all 8 bits of the DFILE2 byte), not an interleave.
    expandHiresBytePair() below matches FUSE's real behavior now.

  - What FUSE calls "hires" is a four-way family (DECR bits 2..0 = 4/5/
    6/7: HIRESATTR/HIRESATTRALTD/HIRES/HIRESDOUBLECOL — see
    peripherals/scld.h), not the single mode this port implements. Only
    HIRES (0x06 exactly — data from DFILE1's bitmap + DFILE2's bitmap,
    both via the same interleaved-thirds addressing) is implemented
    here; expandHiresBytePair() is only correct for that one. The other
    three source their second byte from an attribute area instead of a
    bitmap area (HIRESATTR: DFILE1's own attribute byte; HIRESATTRALTD:
    DFILE2's attribute byte; HIRESDOUBLECOL: the same DFILE1 byte
    twice) — see display.c lines ~391-412 for the exact per-mode byte
    sourcing if implementing them later. Video.cpp's caller is
    responsible for only invoking hi-res rendering when
    SCLD::videoMode == 0x06 exactly, not just "bit 2 is set".
